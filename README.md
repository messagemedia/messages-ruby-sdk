## Introduction

TODO: Add a description

## Building

The generated code depends on a few Ruby gems. The references to these gems are added in the gemspec file. The easiest way to resolve the dependencies, build the gem and install it is through Rake:

1. Install Rake if not already installed: `gem install rake`
2. Install Bundler if not already installed: `gem install bundler`
3. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.
4. Invoke: `rake install`

Alternatively, you can build and install the gem manually:

1. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.
2. Run the build command: `gem build messages.gemspec`
3. Run the install command: `gem install messages-1.1.0.gem`

## Installation

The following section explains how to use the messages ruby gem in a new Rails project using RubyMine&trade;. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

### 1. Starting a new project

Close any existing projects in RubyMine&trade; by selecting `File -> Close Project`. Next, click on `Create New Project` to create a new project from scratch.

![Create a new project in RubyMine - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=Messages&step=createNewProject0)

Next, provide `TestApp` as the project name, choose `Rails Application` as the project type, and click `OK`.

![Create a new Rails Application in RubyMine - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=Messages&step=createNewProject1)

In the next dialog make sure that the correct Ruby SDK is being used (>= 2.6 and < 3.1) and click `OK`.

### 2. Add reference of the gem

In order to use the Tester gem in the new project we must add a gem reference. Locate the `Gemfile` in the Project Explorer window under the `TestApp` project node. The file contains references to all gems being used in the project. Here, add the reference to the library gem by adding the following line: `gem 'messages', '1.1.0'`

### 3. Adding a new Rails Controller

Once the `TestApp` project is created, a folder named `controllers` will be visible in the *Project Explorer* under the following path: `TestApp > app > controllers`. Right click on this folder and select `New -> Run Rails Generator...`.

![Run Rails Generator on Controllers Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=Messages&gemVer=1.1.0&gemName=messages&step=addCode0)

Selecting the said option will popup a small window where the generator names are displayed. Here, select the `controller` template.

![Create a new Controller](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=Messages&step=addCode1)

Next, a popup window will ask you for a Controller name and included Actions. For controller name provide `Hello` and include an action named `Index` and click `OK`.

![Add a new Controller](https://apidocs.io/illustration/ruby?workspaceFolder=Messages&gemVer=1.1.0&gemName=messages&step=addCode2)

A new controller class named `HelloController` will be created in a file named `hello_controller.rb` containing a method named `Index`. In this method, add code for initialization and a sample for its usage.

## Test the SDK

To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the SDK in your terminal and execute the following command:

```
rake
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| `basic_auth_user_name` | `String` | The username to use with basic authentication |
| `basic_auth_password` | `String` | The password to use with basic authentication |
| `connection` | `Faraday::Connection` | The Faraday connection object passed by the SDK user for making requests |
| `adapter` | `Faraday::Adapter` | The Faraday adapter object passed by the SDK user for performing http requests |
| `timeout` | `Float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| `max_retries` | `Integer` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| `retry_interval` | `Float` | Pause in seconds between retries. <br> **Default: 1** |
| `backoff_factor` | `Float` | The amount to multiply each successive retry's interval amount by in order to provide backoff. <br> **Default: 2** |
| `retry_statuses` | `Array` | A list of HTTP statuses to retry. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |
| `retry_methods` | `Array` | A list of HTTP methods to retry. <br> **Default: %i[get put]** |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```ruby
client = Messages::Client.new(
  basic_auth_user_name: 'BasicAuthUserName',
  basic_auth_password: 'BasicAuthPassword',
)
```

## Authorization

This API uses `Basic Authentication`.

## API Errors

Here is the list of errors that the API might throw.

| HTTP Status Code | Error Description | Exception Class |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| 402 | The feature that you are trying to use is disabled by default. Please contact tech support at support@messagemedia.com.au | `APIException` |
