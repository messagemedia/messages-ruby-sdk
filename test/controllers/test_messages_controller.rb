  # Submit one or more (up to 100 per request) SMS or text to voice messages for delivery.
  #The most basic message has the following structure:
  #```json
  #{
  #    "messages": [
  #        {
  #            "content": "My first message!",
  #            "destination_number": "+61491570156"
  #        }
  #    ]
  #}
  #```
  #More advanced delivery features can be specified by setting the following properties in a message:
  #- ```callback_url``` A URL can be included with each message to which Webhooks will be pushed to
  #  via a HTTP POST request. Webhooks will be sent if and when the status of the message changes as
  #  it is processed (if the delivery report property of the request is set to ```true```) and when replies
  #  are received. Specifying a callback URL is optional.
  #- ```content``` The content of the message. This can be a Unicode string, up to 5,000 characters long.
  #  Message content is required.
  #- ```delivery_report``` Delivery reports can be requested with each message. If delivery reports are requested, a webhook
  #  will be submitted to the ```callback_url``` property specified for the message (or to the webhooks)
  #  specified for the account every time the status of the message changes as it is processed. The
  #  current status of the message can also be retrieved via the Delivery Reports endpoint of the
  #  Messages API. Delivery reports are optional and by default will not be requested.
  #- ```destination_number``` The destination number the message should be delivered to. This should be specified in E.164
  #  international format. For information on E.164, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164.
  #  A destination number is required.
  #- ```format``` The format specifies which format the message will be sent as, ```SMS``` (text message)
  #  or ```TTS``` (text to speech). With ```TTS``` format, we will call the destination number and read out the
  #  message using a computer generated voice. Specifying a format is optional, by default ```SMS``` will be used.
  #- ```source_number``` A source number may be specified for the message, this will be the number that
  #  the message appears from on the handset. By default this feature is _not_ available and will be ignored
  #  in the request. Please contact <support@messagemeda.com> for more information. Specifying a source
  #  number is optional and a by default a source number will be assigned to the message.
  #- ```source_number_type``` If a source number is specified, the type of source number may also be
  #  specified. This is recommended when using a source address type that is not an internationally
  #  formatted number, available options are ```INTERNATIONAL```, ```ALPHANUMERIC``` or ```SHORTCODE```. Specifying a
  #  source number type is only valid when the ```source_number``` parameter is specified and is optional.
  #  If a source number is specified and no source number type is specified, the source number type will be
  #  inferred from the source number, however this may be inaccurate.
  #- ```scheduled``` A message can be scheduled for delivery in the future by setting the scheduled property.
  #  The scheduled property expects a date time specified in ISO 8601 format. The scheduled time must be
  #  provided in UTC and is optional. If no scheduled property is set, the message will be delivered immediately.
  #- ```message_expiry_timestamp``` A message expiry timestamp can be provided to specify the latest time
  #  at which the message should be delivered. If the message cannot be delivered before the specified
  #  message expiry timestamp elapses, the message will be discarded. Specifying a message expiry 
  #  timestamp is optional.
  #- ```metadata``` Metadata can be included with the message which will then be included with any delivery
  #  reports or replies matched to the message. This can be used to create powerful two-way messaging
  #  applications without having to store persistent data in the application. Up to 10 key / value metadata data
  #  pairs can be specified in a message. Each key can be up to 100 characters long, and each value up to 
  #  256 characters long. Specifying metadata for a message is optional.
  #The response body of a successful POST request to the messages endpoint will include a ```messages```
  #property which contains a list of all messages submitted. The list of messages submitted will
  #reflect the list of messages included in the request, but each message will also contain two new
  #properties, ```message_id``` and ```status```. The returned message ID will be a 36 character UUID
  #which can be used to check the status of the message via the Get Message Status endpoint. The status
  #of the message which reflect the status of the message at submission time which will always be
  #```queued```. See the Delivery Reports section of this documentation for more information on message
  #statues.
  #*Note: when sending multiple messages in a request, all messages must be valid for the request to be successful.
  #If any messages in the request are invalid, no messages will be sent.*
