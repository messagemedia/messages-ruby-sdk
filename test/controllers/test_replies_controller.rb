  # Check for any replies that have been received.
  #Replies are messages that have been sent from a handset in response to a message sent by an
  #application or messages that have been sent from a handset to a inbound number associated with
  #an account, known as a dedicated inbound number (contact <support@messagemedia.com> for more
  #information on dedicated inbound numbers).
  #Each request to the check replies endpoint will return any replies received that have not yet
  #been confirmed using the confirm replies endpoint. A response from the check replies endpoint
  #will have the following structure:

  #Each reply will contain details about the reply message, as well as details of the message the reply was sent
  #in response to, including any metadata specified. Every reply will have a reply ID to be used with the
  #confirm replies endpoint.
  #*Note: The source number and destination number properties in a reply are the inverse of those
  #specified in the message the reply is in response to. The source number of the reply message is the
  #same as the destination number of the original message, and the destination number of the reply
  #message is the same as the source number of the original message. If a source number
  #wasn't specified in the original message, then the destination number property will not be present
  #in the reply message.*
  #Subsequent requests to the check replies endpoint will return the same reply messages and a maximum
  #of 100 replies will be returned in each request. Applications should use the confirm replies endpoint
  #in the following pattern so that replies that have been processed are no longer returned in
  #subsequent check replies requests.
  #1. Call check replies endpoint
  #2. Process each reply message
  #3. Confirm all processed reply messages using the confirm replies endpoint
  #*Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply messages rather than polling
  #the check replies endpoint.*

  #to allow for robust processing of reply messages. Once one or more reply messages have been processed
  #they can then be confirmed using the confirm replies endpoint so they are no longer returned in
  #subsequent check replies requests.
