  # Check for any delivery reports that have been received.
  #Delivery reports are a notification of the change in status of a message as it is being processed.
  #Each request to the check delivery reports endpoint will return any delivery reports received that
  #have not yet been confirmed using the confirm delivery reports endpoint. A response from the check
  #delivery reports endpoint will have the following structure:

  #Each delivery report will contain details about the message, including any metadata specified
  #and the new status of the message (as each delivery report indicates a change in status of a
  #message) and the timestamp at which the status changed. Every delivery report will have a 
  #unique delivery report ID for use with the confirm delivery reports endpoint.
  #*Note: The source number and destination number properties in a delivery report are the inverse of
  #those specified in the message that the delivery report relates to. The source number of the
  #delivery report is the destination number of the original message.*
  #Subsequent requests to the check delivery reports endpoint will return the same delivery reports
  #and a maximum of 100 delivery reports will be returned in each request. Applications should use the
  #confirm delivery reports endpoint in the following pattern so that delivery reports that have been
  #processed are no longer returned in subsequent check delivery reports requests.
  #1. Call check delivery reports endpoint
  #2. Process each delivery report
  #3. Confirm all processed delivery reports using the confirm delivery reports endpoint
  #*Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply messages rather than
  #polling the check delivery reports endpoint.*
